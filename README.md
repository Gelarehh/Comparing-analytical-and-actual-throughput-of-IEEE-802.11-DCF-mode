# Comparing-analytical-and-actual-throughput-of-IEEE-802.11-DCF-mode

A network using IEEE 802.11 DCF mode as MAC protocol is considered. There are n nodes in the network where they all always have packets to transmit. It is assumed that all the nodes can hear all the transmissions, including RTS, CTS, DATA, and ACK.

Varying the number of nodes, n, from 2 to 10, with steps of 2 (n=2,4,6,8,10), the throughput of the network can be calculated in two ways: analytical and actual.
