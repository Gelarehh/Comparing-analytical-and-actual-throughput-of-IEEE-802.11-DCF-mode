## Comparing Results of Analatycal and Actual Throughput 

The following diagram presents a good agreement between the analytical and simulation results. The gap between the values earned by each method can be justified by the difference between the simulation's environment and the model's assumptions.

Besides, the performance results show that the system's throughput depends on various factors, including busy probability, collision probability, and the number of stations.
